# api-security-fintech
This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the implementation of an **end-to-end API security framework** applied to a **fintech transactional use case**. It aims to showcase how multiple security frameworks (OWASP, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, NIST 800-204A, GDPR) can be applied coherently in a modern microservices architecture.
